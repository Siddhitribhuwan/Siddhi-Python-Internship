#Task: Guessing Game

#Write a Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user should then try to guess the number. The program should provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" until the correct number is guessed.

import random
def guess_num():

  secret_num = random.randint(1, 100)
  guesses = 0

  while True:
    try:
      guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
      guesses += 1
      if guess == secret_num:
        print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in {guesses} tries.")
        break
      elif guess < secret_num:
        print("Too low, try again.")
      else:
        print("Too high, try again.")
    except ValueError:
